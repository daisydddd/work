workï¼šCompleted the task of splitting some tables to facilitate future data updates, and is doing related tables
Problems encountered so far:
In the last time you suggested, I began to split the table, the process found that some more time to split up the table is too cumbersome, and in the process of importing the sql, a variety of tables need to carry out different preprocessing before you can import.
